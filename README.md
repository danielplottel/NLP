NLP analysis and modelling

The content has been gathered from the popular academic website arXiv.org for articles tagged as computer science content (though some of these are in mathematics or physics categories). The fields are:

• Title: the full title <br>
• Abstract: the full abstract <br>
• InformationTheory: a "1" if it is classified as an Information Theory article, otherwise "0". <br>
• ComputerVision: a "1" if it is classified as a Computer Vision article, otherwise "0". <br>
• ComputationalLinguistics: a "1" if it is classified as a Computational Linguistics article, otherwise "0".

The three classes are ComputationalLinguistics, InformationTheory and ComputerVision. These can occur in any combination, so an article could be all three at once, two, one or none.
